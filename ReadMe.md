# About me



A curious guy from Bogota, Colombia; who felt in love about data, AI and developing. Lets talk in english, portuguese and spanish as well. I love dance everyday, keep my shape on gym and enjoy games at night.   

## My Background.

I am a Business Analyst with a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Rosario University. I am focused on data-driven solutions to enhance management and decision-making. I have worked with multidisciplinary teams worldwide, using Scrum to align user requirements with technical solutions. I possess extensive knowledge in Power BI, Power Platform, Azure Synapse, Azure Datalake, Pandas and Data Lake. I am proficient in managing databases such as SQL, SharePoint, SAP, and SalesForce. Finally, I have a strong background in process automation using Visual Basic and Power Automate.
